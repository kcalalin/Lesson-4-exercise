        <h1>Interneting Is Easy</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of our webpage. there are six levels of headings.
  
        </p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how we make an unordered Lists</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This how we make an ordered list.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Notice the "ol" element wrapping everything?</li>
            <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
            <li>
                we should be noticing things is in precise order, because this is an odered list.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Sometimes</em>, we need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase
        </p>
        <p>Other times, we need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase
        </p>
        <p>
            <em><strong>And sometimes you need to show</strong></em>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Thanks for reading! Learning HTML should be getting easier now.</p>
        <p>Regards, <br/>
